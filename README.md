# faceRecognition_api

The application is currently deployed [here](https://lnkd.in/duxFY92A](https://face-recognition-cgva.onrender.com/)
It basically uses Clarifai API to recognize a face on the picture you provide as a link to .jpg file and also lets you create your own account by registering and keeping track of the number of face-detections you performed so far. So it's combining many different things!

For deployment, I opted to use render.com as a free tool, which allowed me to deploy the front-end, back-end, and create a PostgreSQL database on the same platform, thereby providing a costless solution. While the course suggests using Heroku for deployment, I found render.com to be more suitable for my needs.
